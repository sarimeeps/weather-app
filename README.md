# Weather with sarimeeps
This is a simple one page weather app that displays the current forecast as well as the forecast for the following four days.

## Technologies and Services Used
- React.js (https://react.dev/)
- Openweathermap API (https://openweathermap.org/)

## How to run locally
1. Make sure to have the following installed on your local machine:
   `Node.js version 20.13.0 LTS`
   
3. Download the zip folder from Github and extract folder

4. Open folder in vscode and enter the following command in the terminal to install dependencies: `npm i`

5. In App.jsx, the link for the api is missing an API key
   - Go to https://openweathermap.org/ and create an account (it is free!)
   - Copy and paste your API key into `apid=[API_KEY]` (remove square brackets)

6. Type in `npm run dev` to run the program! :)
